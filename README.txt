This is a C++ program that simulates a card game between two players or one player and an AI. The program starts by asking the user to choose between a player vs player or player vs AI game. Then, the program prompts the user to enter the names of the players. Next, the program displays the game rules and sleeps for 18 seconds. After that, it creates two player objects with 25 prestige points each and an empty set of cards. Then, the program enters a loop where it allows the user to select and add cards to their deck from a reserve of cards. The user can choose to add the 20 cards with the highest attack, defense, magic power, or overall score, or they can manually select the cards. Finally, the program displays the user's selected deck.
